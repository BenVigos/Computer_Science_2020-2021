# Task 4

## 1

### The matrix system was created as a way for teachers to know where students are in case of an emergency. It was originally 8 questions long, although some of them were unnecessary. The most important things were the time of departure and return, location and students phone number. As we can understand, the intendend users were students. 

## 2

### Developing the website might be difficult, google provides everything for you with google forms. Bugs might arise and there's no one to give technical support.

## 3

### Being hosted on a local computer makes it more secure and gives the admin full control over the system. A limitation could be the lack of technical support and that if the computer fails the data could be lost

## 4

### Direct changeover => Stop using google forms completely and start using new matrix.  Parallel run => Use both at the same time.  Phased implementation => Slow integration from one to the other

## 5

### A deficient transition would lead to a lot of time being spent on trying to fix possible issues. Also if the data was lost it would be very hard for them to be recovered if possible at all.
