# This is unit 2

## Criteria A: Planning

### Context of the Problem:

An alien civilization came to contact with me and asked me to create a cool, fun and interesting counting system. The contraption should be able to count from 0 to 9.

### Justification for the solution:

I wanted to create something interesting and intuitive, something that can be memorized and can be easily read when viewed properly. I used Arduino because it's easy to use and has many capabilities. There's also room for a lot of further expansion in the future.

### Criteria for Success:

* Easy to read
* Can be memorized 
* Looks cool
* No visible cables

## Criteria B: Design
