# Unit 2 part 2

## Criteria A: Planning

### Context of the problem
The international space association tasked us with creating a system to send messages between Earth and the moon by using only two buttons and a light. The messages would be sent from earth in the form of morse code and from the moon in the form of biary.

### Justification for the solution
We used Arduino because it is easily accessible, relatively low cost, relatively easy to use and we can find quite a lot of support on the internet. We wanted to strike a good balance between not needing too many button clicks and being fast.

### Success Criteria
