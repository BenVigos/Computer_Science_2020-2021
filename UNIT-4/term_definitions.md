# Defining terms

**IP address -** It stands for "Internet Protocol" and it's an identifier, meaning that each IP address is unique to a computer and it's what allows other devices to send it information.

**IP version 4 -** IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 2^32 or about 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. It also reserves special address blocks for private networks (~18 million addresses) and multicast addresses (~270 million addresses).

**IP version 6 -** IPv6 is the newest version of the IP and it uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2^128. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.

**SSH -** SSH, also known as Secure Shell is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. It provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.

**SCP -** Secure copy protocol (SCP) is a means of securely transferring computer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It's based on SSH

**Terminal commands -** 
- ls -> lists files and directories
- cat -> creates file
- echo -> displays lines of text that are passed as arguments
- cd -> changes directory
- chmod -> changes a files permissions

**Server -** A server is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients, can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet.

**Router -** A router receives and sends data on computer networks. Routers are sometimes confused with network hubs, modems, or network switches. However, routers can combine the functions of these components, and connect with these devices, to improve Internet access or help create business networks.

**Network switch -** A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN) and forwards data packets to and from those devices.

**wLAN** wLAN Stands for "Wireless Local Area Network." It's a network that allows devices to connect and communicate wirelessly, over WiFi.

**LAN** LAN Stands for "Local Area Network." It's a network that allows devices to connect and communicate through a wired connection, usually ethernet cables.
